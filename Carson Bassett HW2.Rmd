# Problem 1 (20 points)

During class you completed an activity in which you practiced `git` commands and operations (such as forking a repository, cloning it using `git clone`, and uploading changes using `git push`).

In this exercise you will used **markdown** tools discussed in class. 

## Part A

You must **create a table** that shows the courses you are currently enrolled in, using the following for the headers of the table: 

- Prefix: in bold letters (such as **COP**)
- Number: in bold letters (such as **2073**)
- Name: in italics (such as _Introduction to Data Science_)
- Credits (such as 3)

```{r}
tab <- matrix(c("COP", "2073", "Intro to Data Science", "3","FIN" , "2001", "Intro to Business Finance", "3", "Eco", "2013", "Principles of Macroeconomics", "3"), ncol=4, byrow=TRUE)
colnames(tab) <- c('Prefix:','Number:','Name:','Credits')
rownames(tab) <- c('Class 1','Class 2','Class 3')
tab <- as.table(tab)
print(tab)
```


## Part B


Take a screenshot of the GitHub repo you used in HW 01, add the screenshot file to the repo, and include it in this document (review how to insert a picture using markdown).

# Problem 2 (30 points)

For this problem, you are asked to create a list of **4 concepts** you have learned about so far this semester. Include the name of the course as a sub-heading (that is, using `##`), and the concepts as an unordered list. Include a link to information about _at least one_ of the concepts you listed (for example a link to the Wikipedia page about that concept/topics).

_Edit this `.Rmd` file to include the solutions here._

## Intro to Business Finance
* The Federal Reserve acts with monetary policy
* The US Government acts with fiscal policy
[Source](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy.htm)

## Principles of Macroeconomics
* GDP is private consumption + gross private investment + government investment + government spending + (exports – imports)
* GDP per capita is a country's GDP divided by its total population


# Problem 3 (25 points)

In this problem you will practice some basic R operations. Include solutions to each items by inserting a new R chunk of code (make sure you run the chunk so that the output is displayed)


(a) Create a variable called `my_name` that contains _your preferred name_.

```{r}
my_name <- "Carson"
my_name
```


(b) Create a variable called `name_length` that holds how many letters are in `my_name`.

```{r}
name_length <- nchar(my_name, type = "chars", allowNA = FALSE, keepNA = NA)
name_length
```


(c) Show which value is bigger: $e^\pi$ or $\pi^e$. (Use the correct expressions for Euler's constant $e$ and the irrational number $\pi$ in R)

```{r}
if (exp(1)^pi > pi^exp(1)) {
  print("e^pi is bigger")
}else{
  print("pi^e is bigger")
}
```


(d) Use the colon operator `:` to create a vector `v` of numbers from 31 to 86. Find the length of this vector using the `length()` function.

```{r}
length(31:86)
```


(e) Use the `seq()` function to produce a range of number from -5 to 10 in 0.5 increments.

```{r}
seq(from = -5, to = 10, by = 0.5)
```


# Problem 4 (25 points)

(a) (10 points) Define a function `imperial_to_metric` that takes in **two arguments**: a number of feet and a number of inches. The function should return the equivalent length in meters

```{r}
imperical_to_metric <- function(feet, inches) {
  meters <- ((feet * 12) + inches) * 0.0254
  return(meters)
}
```


> To convert a length `L` from feet (`ft`) and inches (`inches`) to meters (`m`), one can use the relation: `L(m) = L(ft) × 0.3048 + L(inches) × 0.0254`


(b) (5 points) Create a variable `height_in_meters` by passing your height in imperial to the `imperial_to_metric` function.

```{r}
height_in_meters <- imperical_to_metric(5,10)
height_in_meters
```


(c) (5 points) Evaluate `round(3.1415)`, `factorial(12)`, `mean(1:17)`.

```{r}
round(3.1415)
factorial(12)
mean(1:17)
```


(d) (5 points) Create an object named `die` that contains the numbers one through six. Simulate a roll of the die with `R`’s `sample()` function. 

```{r}
die <- 1:6
sample(die)
```
